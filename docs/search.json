      "description": "Inference tutorial for workshop on RStudio\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nFormulas for statistical inference as found in many introductory statistics books. In each situation, the inference calculations are based on the quantities used, such as \\(\\bar{x}\\), s, n, n, \\(\\bar{x}_1\\), \\(\\bar{x}_2\\),\\(s_1\\), \\(s_2\\),\\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\).\nThe usual procedure involves three distinct steps:\nReducing a data frame to the quantities used in the calculations.\nPlugging those quantities into formulas.\nExtracting a number from a probability distribution: z, t, \\(\\chi^2\\), and so on.\nThere are many problems with this approach to inference, among them:\nStudents often have trouble dealing with the formulas used, whether because of general math anxiety or lack of mastery of algebraic notation.\nThe formulas are different for each setting of statistical inference, whereas the actual logic of statistical inference is the same. Teaching the formulas obscures the logic of inference.\nSimple formulas are available for only a handful of statistics. As a result, the conventional statistics course focuses on this handful, even though they may not address a genuine statistical question. A particularly glaring omission is the consideration of covariates.\nThe formulas are not data-centric. That is to say, the formulas for inference don’t involve the actual data. Instead, they involve summary statistics of the data: means, standard deviations, and so on.\nThe purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to statistical inference calculations that work directly from the data. You’ll see a handful of narrow-purpose R functions that correspond to individual settings, a single proportion, two proportions, one-sample mean, difference of two means, comparing many means, goodness of fit a one-variable, independence in two-way tables.\nThese provide you a capability to “teach to the tests,” that is to treat the classical tests as objects in themselves, studying their behavior rather than the calculations that underlie them.\nAnticipating a discussion for another time: You may well wonder what is the point of teaching narrow-purpose R-language functions. Isn’t the whole point to teach the calculation? Is the computer doing so much of the work that the student fails to learn the underlying concepts? These are important questions to discuss and we think our answers may surprise you.\nInference on means\nThere are two main functions for doing inference on means.\nUsing the package mosaic, df_stats(), which makes it easy to find descriptive statistics. t_test(), which carries out the standard calculations for that hypothesis test and produces both p-values and confidence intervals.\nThe syntax to type in any RStudio code uses the following format: goal/formula/data computational template. In this format, goal is what action you want RStudio to complete, such as a graph or statsitical calulations. The formula is where you tell R the response variable followed by the explanatory variable. The formula always has the explanatory variable following the tilda (~) symbol. If there is a response variable, then it precedes the ~. The data is what you use to tell RStudio what dataframe the variables can be found in. To illustrate, we’ll look at the mean height from the NHANES dataframe. NHANES is data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study.This dataframe has many variables. Let’s look at the height of participants that are aged 2 years or older, which is the variable Height.\n\n  response     mean       sd\n1   Height 161.8778 20.18657\n  response Gender     mean       sd\n1   Height female 156.6159 16.79195\n2   Height   male 167.1913 21.86631\n\nThe first df_stats() calculation shows the estimate of the mean standard deviation from the NHANES data. The second breaks this down by Gender, which provides a straightforward way of comparing the two means.\nNote that df_stats() just computes descriptive statistics. And you may find it inadequate to compare the two means. You can find other descriptive statistics such as median, variance, and five-number summary by adding them to the command.\nThe way of doing the hypothesis test on the mean (which incidentally gives the confidence interval as well) is a t-test. If you know that the mean is a certain value, then type mu=that value. Suppose you think the mean height of an American is 69 inches. Then type mu=60 into the R command.\n\n\n\nIf you want to test if there is a differnce in a two sample independent means, then you need to type in the variable separated by the factor. The factor is a categorical variable that divides a qualitative variable between two samples. In you want to see if there is a difference in heights between genders, then you would type:\n\n\n\nSuppose you want to test if the pulse rates (Pulse) between Gender is different in the NHANES dataframe, type in what you think the command would look like to produce the results.\n\n\n\nProportion Test\nAnalogously to t_test(), the binom.test() and prop.test() functions do inference on sample proportions. For a single proportion, binom.test() produces the confidence interval on the sample proportion. For two proportions, prop.test() gives the confidence interval on the difference between the two proportions.\nTo illustrate, consider the height from the Galton data frame, which is from Galton’s study of the relationship between the heights of parents and their adult children.let’s look at the proportion of people in Galton’s data who are taller than 65 inches.\n\n\n\nNow consider if you want to find out if the proportion of males taller than 65 inches is more than the proportion of females taller than 65 inches. You can also find the confidence interval of the difference in proportions.\n\n\n\nAside: Proportions are Means\nIt may seem a little odd that we are giving you two different functions for proportion tests. Why not just have one function that does it all, as with t_test()? But different approximations are being done with binom.test() and with prop.test().\nProportions are Means\nSo you would like to have just one function for inference on proportions? But while we’re at it, let’s have the same functions for inference on both means and proportions. Like this:\n\n\n\nOnce you have overcome your reaction that “t-tests are not for proportions,” compare the confidence intervals and p-values from the t-test to those from binom.test() and prop.test(). They are effectively the same.\nChi-squared Test\nThe chisq.test() function in R carries out the test. For introductory statistics, it’s used in mainly two ways:\ntest whether a vector of counts is consistent with a given probability model.\ntest whether two categorical variables are independent of one another by examining a contingency table of counts.\nFirst let’s to see if a vector count is consistent with a given probability model. Use tally() to produce the vector, then apply chisq.test(). To illustrate, let’s use the KidsFeet data frame, which has several categorical variables. The variable vector_of_counts is a vector of the number of left-handed and right-handed people. The command chisq.test(vector_of_counts) will check whether the number of left-handed kids is consistent with a hypothesized 50-50 split in handedness.\n\n\n\nThe reason to do the test in two steps – tally then test – is to let you look at the tally. We haven’t done that in the above chunk, but you can easily add the necessary lines to the command block. (Hint: Give vector_of_counts as a command.)\nIf you wanted to check the counts of handedness against a more realistic hypothesis than a 50-50 split, you can give an argument p = specifying the hypothesized proportions. Try, for instance, p = c(.25, .75).\nNow test if two variables are independent. The tally() command can also be used to produce the contingency table, then the chisq.test() can be used on the contingency table. To illustrate, again use the KidsFeet data frame. The variable cross_tabulation is the contingency table of hand dominance and sex. To check whether sex is independent of handedness use the command chisq.test(cross_tabulation).\n\n\n\nIf you would like to look at the contingency table, think of a command that you can add to the above command.\n\n\n\n",

This two-day workshop will be offered twice: first on Thursday, June 10, and Friday, June 11, and second on Friday, July 9, and Saturday, July 10.\nThe plan for this StatPREP intro workshop is to have presentations on what it means to have your statistics class be datacentric, and the philosophy behind the ASA’s GAISE statement. There will be hands-on activities on using some of the activities written for the Little Apps, and time for small group discussions.\nAt the end of the first day there will be time for socializing, and the second day starts with a social hour. The idea is to create a community of instructors who can ask each other for advice. If you are new to teaching statistics or have been teaching for awhile but would like to add more life to your statistics course, this is a great workshop to attend to learn how to incorporate data into your course and be exposed to the StatPREP material.\nAgenda\n\n\n\n",

The StatPREP team works with college instructors who want to teach statistics with a modern pedagogy and with a direct emphasis on real data wrangling and visualization techniques.\nSummer 2017 was our first summer faculty development workshop. These were expanded geographically in 2018 and 2019. In 2020, our workshops were postponed due to COVID-19. In summers 2018-19 1½ day workshops were run in six different major metropolitan areas. The workshops are designed for instructors whose primary training may not be in statistics and whom may not have previous experience with statistical computing.\nStarting in summer 2021, we will return to hosting workshops in a new, online format.\nStatPREP fosters the widespread use of data-centered methods and pedagogies in introductory statistics courses. This in turn enhances the preparation of students to meet the demands of a data-driven workplace and to use the newly available resources in our data-centric world. StatPREP works directly with college-level instructors, both online and in community-based workshops, to develop the understanding and skills needed to work and teach with modern data.\nThe project will offers an extended professional development program for mathematics faculty, particularly at two-year institutions, who teach introductory statistics. We’ve established regional communities of practice (“hubs”) to support these instructors and provide them a national online support network with statistics education experts. This project also contributes to the goal to “improve STEM learning and learning environments by investigating the effectiveness of this professional development model as a catalyst for community transformation. The combined resources and reach of the MAA, ASA, and AMATYC ensure the sustainability of StatPREP and the availability of this program to the largest possible audience.\n\n\n\n",

We couldn’t do all of them at the start, so we picked four\nIt wouldn’t be appropriate for us to endorse specific commercial textbooks, so we made our initial choice of books based on one fundamental criterion: accessibility to students.\nTwo of the books we picked are open-source and available for free online.\nOpenIntro Statistics\nWe are impressed by the number of StatPREP faculty participants already using this.\nStatistics Using Technology\nThe author, Kathryn Kozak, is a StatPREP co-PI.\nAnother open-source stats textbook we want to point out is Statistical Inference via Data Science by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. We didn’t include this in our list because it is relatively new and because it takes a substantially different view on stats, orienting stats around data science concepts such as wrangling and visualization.\nThe other two books in the companion list are commercial, but both are widely used in two-year colleges that are readily accessible to instructors.\nTriola’s Elementary Statistics.\nSullivan’s Statistics: Informed Decisions Using Data\nWe hope that having a key to the StatPREP materials for the Triola book and the Sullivan book will help many StatPREP participants take first steps toward a data-centric view of statistics. This is so particular since the structure and content of these books makes it difficult for the first-time instructor to coordinate lessons from the book with the StatPREP materials.\n\n\n\n",

Then there was an introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n\n\nPresenters: Joe Roith and Kathryn Kozak\n\n\nLink to recording Please note captions are auto-generated by Zoom, so please pardon any spelling errors.\n\nOctober 2021 Webinar An Introduction to Confidence Intervals: An Interactive Webinar\n\nThe StatPREP Little Apps are a collection of free, easy-to-use online tools that help students visualize the statistical concepts using real-world data.We will explore the StatPREP Little App for Confidence Intervals. In this interactive session, we will visualize the characteristics of a confidence interval, demonstrate what a confidence level is, resample data, and create side-by-side comparisons. These visualizations can be used to introduce the topic as well as in classroom assessments.\n\n\nPresenter: Rona Axelrod\n\n\nLink to recording\n\nSeptember 2021 Webinar Experiencing Sampling Variation Early and Often in an Intro Statistics Coruse\n\nUsing data centric lessons and visualization tools such as the “Points and Densities Little App” have supported my students’ understanding of the key role sampling variation plays in statistical investigation. I love overhearing “Hey, my sample looks different from yours!” It opens the door to explore whether there is still a consistent story to tell about a variable.\n\n\nPresenter: Carol Howald\n\n\nLink to recording\n\nFebruary 2021 Resources for Teaching Statistics\n\nTeaching an introductory statistics course, but you need some guidance. The ASA/MAA Joint Committee, the ASA/AMATYC Joint Committee, and the StatPREP grant all have resources to help you teach statistics. This webinar demonstrated the resources from each of these sources.\n\n\nPresenters: Julie Hanson, Rebecca Wong, Kathryn Kozak, and Kari Lock Morgan\n\n\nlink to recording\n\nOctober 2020 Data Science in a Box\n\nOur guest was Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, a highly regarded teacher and one of the authors of the OpenIntro textbooks as well as the online “Data Science in a Box” package of teaching materials. We talked with Mine about the upcoming new edition of the simulation-based OpenIntro textbook and how you can use it in your class. We also covered a range of topics, from remote teaching of statistics and data science to Mine’s (educated!) predictions about where intro stats is heading in the 2020s.\n\n\nPresenter: Danny Kaplan.\n\n\nlink to recording\n\nSeptember 2020 Using the Activities for the New Little Apps\n\nIn April 2020, a webinar presented the new StatPREP Little Apps. This webinar discusses several activities tailored to use the new Little Apps and how to use them in class.\n\n\nPresenters: Kate Kozak, Danny Kaplan.\n\nAugust 11, 2020 Preparing for the fall semester\n\nThere are many materials on the StatPREP site that can help you teach data-centric statistics. This webinar described some of these resources that are ready for Fall 2020.\n\nAugust 7, 2020 Building Community in a Remote Learning Environment\n\nA sense of belonging and community is still critical to ensure that students remain engaged and enthusiastic while being in a remote learning environment. Students may be accustomed to find a sense of belonging from interactions with their peers and classmates in a physical classroom setting. As instruction is delivered virtually, students may likely feel less connected, uncertain, or distracted in their new learning environment. Creating a virtual community is just as important for remote learning as it is in a physical classroom. This webinar presented suggestions to help educators reestablish a sense of belonging for their students.\n\n\nPresenter: Ambika Silva\n\n\nlink to recording\n\nJune 29/30, 2020 Introductory Statistics in the 2020s: A Virtual Workshop for Two-Year College Educators\n\nThis American Statistical Association workshop focused on ideas and activities for teaching introductory statistics in accordance with the American Statistical Association’s GAISE recommendations and “A World Beyond P < 0.05” initiative. Highlighted themes included multivariable thinking, data fluency, misconceptions and limitations of p-values, and alternatives to p-values such as effect sizes.\n\n\nPresenters were Roxy Peck, Rob Gould, Danny Kaplan, Beth Chance, Jeff Witmer, and Kari Lock Morgan.\n\n\nAccess recordings here.\n\nMay 18, 2020 What Every Instructor Should Know About the Bootstrap\n\nStatistical concepts such as sampling distributions, standard errors, and P-values are difficult for many students. A good way to get hands-on experience with these abstract concepts is using bootstrapping and permutation tests, and we’ll demonstrate using a variety of examples. Though bootstrapping has enormous potential in statistics education and practice, there are subtle issues and ways to go wrong. For example, the common combination of nonparametric bootstrapping and bootstrap percentile confidence intervals is less accurate than using t-intervals for small samples, though more accurate for larger samples. The goals of this talk are to provide a deeper understanding of bootstrap methods – how they work, when they work or not, which methods work better– and to highlight pedagogical issues.\n\n\nPresenter: Tim Hesterberg & Kate Kozak\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nApril 23, 2020 Little App Update\n\nWe celebrated the third anniversary of the StatPREP Little Apps by launching a brand new set of apps with a new look and new functionality. Among the changes are a dramatically increased choice of data sets (including those keyed to textbooks often used by StatPREP instructors) and the ability to upload your own CSV files, a feature that lets you freeze a display and show it side-by-side with the current display. The original apps continue to be available at their original web addresses, but we encourage you to switch to the new ones and try out their new capabilities.\n\n\nPresenters: Jennifer Ward & Danny Kaplan\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nMarch 26, 2020 The p-value: Replacing 0.05 with Understanding\n\nThe American Statistical Association’s 2016 P-Value Statement and The American Statistician’s 2019 special issue “Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond p < 0.05” both provide a call for action and change regarding how p-values are taught and used. In particular, they discourage the focus on whether a p-value is less than a specific threshold (e.g. 0.05), and encourage a better understanding of what the p-value actually represents. This talk will discuss ways to replace “p < 0.05” with conceptual understanding of a p-value in introductory statistics courses.\n\n\nAccess recording here\n\nMarch 13, 2020 StatPREP Webinar: Course Curricula & StatPREP\n\nDanny Kaplan and Kate Kozak introduced the three new StatPREP companion tools for Statistics Using Technology by Kozak, OpenIntro Statistics by Diez, et al, and Elementary Statistics by Triola. Do you use one of these books in your introductory statistics classes? If so, watch the webinar recording to learn how StatPREP can help you teach data-centric stats! Even if you don’t use one of the listed books, you may find the materials helpful.\n\n\nPresented by: Danny Kaplan and Kate Kozak\n\n\nAccess recording here\n\nDecember 12, 2019 The Compact Guide to Classical Inference: Why?\n\nIn Dec. 2019, StatPREP.org started the serial publication of a short book for instructors: The Compact Guide to Classical Inference. (Note from March 2020: The full book is available here.](https://dtkaplan.github.io/CompactInference/)) Keeping in mind that StatPREP is about centering statistics education on real data, this book is an anomaly: the introduction of a reframed mathematical approach to statistical inference. The reframed approach unifies into a simple, single standard procedure all the inferential settings found in introductory statistics and carries forward to apply to “advanced” settings such as multiple regression.\n\n\nPresenters: Donna LaLonde & Danny Kaplan\n\n\nThe webinar was a conversation between Donna and Danny about how the many formulae and probability tables of historical statistics can be unified into a single simple test statistic, F, and an expression for the confidence interval in terms of F.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nNovember 5, 2019 Assessment Webinar\n\nAssessment is an integral part of instruction, as it determines whether or not learning goals are being met and makes us ask, “Are students learning what they are supposed to be learning?” Learn how to use the StatPREP Little Apps to make meaningful assessments during this month’s webinar!\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nOctober 23, 2019 MAA Connect\n\nLooking for ways to connect with other StatPREP participants across the country? Do you want to share the wonderful innovated data centric ways you’re teaching your intro stats course? Join the conversation on MAA Connect. This webinar shows you how to get onto MAA connect whether you’re an MAA member or not as well as going over the basics of MAA connect.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nSeptember 19, 2019* Using the Activities for Little App “Rare and Common”\n\nDo you have an unusually high pulse rate? How can a person find out? This webinar will present an activity developed for the Little App called “Common and Rare.” This activity is a group activity that is available to use in a class today. The webinar will show you how to use the activity and the Little App in an introductory Statistics course to introduce and investigate the concept of rare and common events utilizing the normal curve.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nMarch 27, 2019 Using the Little App “Linear Models”\n\nThe webinar gave the first look at the redesign of the Little Apps. The “Linear Models” Little App allows teachers and students to pick between 4 different datasets and then particular variables to investigate a linear regression model between the variables. The webinar showed how to use the Little App in your courses to introduce and investigate regression.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nFebruary 22, 2019 Using the What’s Normal? Class Lesson to Introduce the Normal Distribution\n\nThe webinar presented a classroom lesson called “What’s Normal?” that models data which can be used to explain the normal distribution to your class. The lesson shows the connection between data and the empirical rule of the normal curve.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nJanuary 25, 2019 Introducing Your Students to Multivariable Data\n\nThis webinar was about introducing students to data. The webinar presented two classroom lessons that can be used to explain multivariable data to your class. The first, “A Lesson for the First Day,” is used to show your students how data can be used to answer questions. The second, “Using Google Spreadsheets,” has your students collect data in the classroom. Both of these activities can be completed early in the course.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nOctober 26, 2018 Using Little Apps to teach Two-sample t\n\nThe webinar demonstrated how to use in class the Little Apps “Two-sample t,” “Proportions”, and “Sampling and resampling.”\n\n\nAccess recording here\n\nSept 7, 2018 Using StatPREP Little Apps to Teach Descriptive Statistics\n\nThis webinar focused on the nuts and bolts of designing a class lesson around using the little apps for teaching descriptive statistics. It included:\n\n\nWhere to find the little apps\nHow to use the little app to demonstrate center and spread\nPicking different response variables\nShowing mean and standard deviation in graphical output\nShowing 95% confidence interval to introduce the idea of inference\nChoosing an explanatory variable and then discussing difference in means\nSome comments on sample size\nTypes of assessment that can be done\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nApril 20, 2018 Getting a handle on ANOVA\nFriday, April 20, 2018\n\nThis webinar is about ANOVA, seen from a perspective that we think makes it much easier to understand and is rooted in a display of data. will lead the webinar. Watch the recording to find out what you have been missing and how to become confident in teaching ANOVA with data. This was our first webinar about the Little Apps series, interactive displays of data designed to let you an your students explore a statistical method or idea. This webinar featured the app on one-variable ANOVA.\n\n\nPresenter: Kate Kozak\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nDec 1, 2017 Writing an interactive tutorial\n\nAn interactive tutorial is an effective way to provide access to data computing to students. Tutorials can be arranged so that a student needs nothing more than a web browser. Within a tutorial, you can pose multiple choice questions, display results of statistical calculations, and provide students with an R session in which they can do their own calculations (with as much or as little guidance from you as you want).\n\n\nThe first step in writing an interactive tutorial is to figure out what you want the tutorial to cover. In the webinar, we started by creating an Rmd file with some simple but authentic statistical content. Then, we added slots for multiple-choice questions and computations. Finally, we activated the components that turn an ordinary Rmd file into an interactive tutorial.\n\n\nPresenter: Danny Kaplan\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nOctober 27, 2017 Using RStudio to manage your website and write course handouts\n\nYou can start teaching with StatPREP without having to set up any statistical software; all our tutorials are available through an ordinary web browser. But many instructors are interested in going deeper. In particular, we’ve had many calls for instruction on how to use RStudio to create your own documents or customize those available through StatPREP.\n\n\nRStudio provides the means to write course notes, handouts, and even interactive tutorials. Together with GitHub, it lets you easily set up course-specific web sites and create materials for those sites. Oh … and since it built on the R software, it’s fully integrated with modern systems for data management, statistics, modeling, and even machine learning.\n\n\nThis webinar introduced RStudio with a focus on creating and updating course web sites and writing course handouts. We started with the RStudio editor, which enables you to revise documents or create new ones. Also covered: How to link your RStudio account to GitHub so that you can manage your course web site from within RStudio; and how to create documents for class handouts—simultaneously generating printable PDF and web versions.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nSeptember 29, 2017 Setting up your own course web site\n\nA course web site is an essential resource for an instructor: it provides a place for you to post links to StatPREP lessons as well other tutorial material and data sets of particular interest to you and even your own course handouts. Many instructors have access to “course management software” systems such as Blackboard or Moodle to which students can log in and view a home page. We focused on another approach which requires no institutional resources and uses a completely free web service: GitHub. In the webinar, we went through the steps of setting up a GitHub account and a course “repository”\"which serves a complete website with an address like ProfAndrews.github.io/Stat4110 (where you’ll customize the ID and course name to suit your situation). Then we demonstrated how to create a web page that can include links to StatPREP tutorials and other resources you choose, upload data sets so your students can easily access them, and all the other things that can make your course more accessible and engaging for students.\n\n\n\n\n",

The material for each workshop is still available at the links following the descriptions.\nThe first theme was an introduction to the philosophy of StatPREP and several of the Little Apps that can be used to demonstrate datacentric ideas to your students. This two-day workshop was offered twice: first time was on Thursday, June 10, and Friday, June 11, and second time was on Friday, July 9, and Saturday, July 10. Link to Google Slides for Day 1\nLink to Google Slides for Day 2\nThe second workshop theme was an Introduction to RStudio. GAISE stresses the idea of using real data, large datasets, and deemphasizing formulas. The best way to follow these guidelines is to use statistical software. One advantage of RStudio is that it is free for students, teachers, and institutions to use. This workshop introduced participants to the basics of RStudio with no prior knowledge of RStudio expected. The two-day workshop was offered twice: first time was on Friday, June 18, and Saturday, June 19, and second time was on Thursday, July 15, and Friday, July 16. Materials presented at the workshop can be access using the following Google slides. Link to Google Slides for Day 1\nLink to Google Slides for Day 2\nAn Intermediate/Advanced RStudio workshop was offered for those who have some experience with RStudio and wanted to learn more. This workshop exposed the attendee to some of the more sophisticated commands of RStudio. The Intermediate/Advance RStudio workshop was offered on Thursday, June 24 through Friday, June 25, and again was offered on Friday, July 23 through Saturday, July 24. Materials presented at the workshop can be access using the following Google slides. Link to Google Slides for Day 1\nLink to Google Slides for Day 2\nYou may be contemplating creating a data science program at your institution, but you are not sure where to start. A one-day workshop workshop featured a panel discussion with several people who have created data science programs at their institutions. The focus was on community colleges because of the unique issue that community college faces with articulation and workforce development. However, all institution types could gain some insights to create a program at their institution, so all faculty at any college or university are invited to review the material and watch the recordings This one day workshop was offered on Friday, June 4, and repeated on Saturday, July 31.\nMaterials presented at the workshop can be access using the following Google slides.\nLink to Google slides\nThe recording of the June 4th panel discussion is available at the following links.\nJune 4th recording\nThe recording of the July 31st panel discussion is available is at the following link.\nJuly 31st recording\n\n\n\n",
