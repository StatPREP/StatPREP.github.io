There\nwill be hands-on activities on using some of the activities written for\nthe Little Apps, and time for small group discussions.\nAt the end of the first day there will be time for socializing,\nand the second day starts with a social hour. The idea is to create a\ncommunity of instructors who can ask each other for advice. If you are\nnew to teaching statistics or have been teaching for awhile but would\nlike to add more life to your statistics course, this is a great\nworkshop to attend to learn how to incorporate data into your course and\nbe exposed to the StatPREP material.\nAgenda\n\n\n\n",

The StatPREP team works with\ncollege instructors who want to teach statistics with a modern pedagogy\nand with a direct emphasis on real data wrangling and visualization\ntechniques.\nSummer 2017 was our first summer faculty development workshop. These\nwere expanded geographically in 2018 and 2019. In 2020, our workshops\nwere postponed due to COVID-19. In summers 2018-19 1½ day workshops were\nrun in six different major metropolitan areas. The workshops are\ndesigned for instructors whose primary training may not be in statistics\nand whom may not have previous experience with statistical\ncomputing.\nStarting in summer 2021, we will return to hosting workshops in a\nnew, online format.\nStatPREP fosters the widespread use of data-centered methods and\npedagogies in introductory statistics courses. This in turn enhances the\npreparation of students to meet the demands of a data-driven workplace\nand to use the newly available resources in our data-centric world.\nStatPREP works directly with college-level instructors, both online and\nin community-based workshops, to develop the understanding and skills\nneeded to work and teach with modern data.\nThe project will offers an extended professional development program\nfor mathematics faculty, particularly at two-year institutions, who\nteach introductory statistics. We’ve established regional communities of\npractice (“hubs”) to support these instructors and provide them a\nnational online support network with statistics education experts. This\nproject also contributes to the goal to “improve STEM learning and\nlearning environments by investigating the effectiveness of this\nprofessional development model as a catalyst for community\ntransformation. The combined resources and reach of the MAA, ASA, and\nAMATYC ensure the sustainability of StatPREP and the availability of\nthis program to the largest possible audience.\n\n\n\n",

The webinar is relevant whether you are still\nformulating your approach to teaching linear regression or if you wish\nto give new strength or energy to your current approach. The session\nwill be interactive and activity-based, leveraging the StatPREP Little\nApps to demonstrate and apply ideas. However, the ideas shared and\ndiscussed in the webinar can be immediately applied to your statistics\nclass whether or not your students have access to technology. Three ways\nto (re)invigorate your teaching of linear regression shared in the\nwebinar are:\n\n\nFocus on the response variable and the guiding question: What\npredicts the explanatory variable?\nIncrease students’ capacity to assess the suitability of a linear\nmodel through exploring and examining sample variability, model\nstrength, and slope as effect size.\nLearn from the StatPREP team about what it means to be\nforward-thinking around the topic of linear regression and the different\nsettings in which regression is used in practice.\n\n\nPresenter: Dr. Helen Burn\n\n\nLink to recording\n\nFebruary 2022 Webinar  Visualization with\nRStudio using ggplot2\n\nTuesday, February 8 at 11:00 am EST, 10:00 am CST, 9:00 am MST, 8:00\nam PST\n\n\nThis webinar demonstrated using the ggplot2 package for data\nvisualization. The fundamentals of ggplot2 and creating graphs such as\nbar plots, histograms, density plots, scatter plots, and time series\ngraphs were emphasized in the webinar.\n\n\nPresenters: Joe Roith and Kathryn Kozak\n\n\nLink to recording\nPlease note captions are auto-generated by Zoom, so please pardon\nany spelling errors.\n\nNovember 2021 Webinar Introduction to RStudo\nand Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nMonday, November 8, 2021, 4:00pm EST, 3:00pm CST, 2:00pm MST, 1:00pm\nPST\n\n\nThis workshop introduced participants to RStudio using RStudio Cloud.\nIn addition RStudio server and RStudio desktop were described. The\nintroduction included packages and reading data into RStudio. Then there\nwas an introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n\n\nPresenters: Joe Roith and Kathryn Kozak\n\n\nLink to recording\nPlease note captions are auto-generated by Zoom, so please pardon\nany spelling errors.\n\nOctober 2021 Webinar An Introduction to\nConfidence Intervals: An Interactive Webinar\n\nThe StatPREP Little Apps are a collection of free, easy-to-use online\ntools that help students visualize the statistical concepts using\nreal-world data.We will explore the StatPREP Little App for Confidence\nIntervals. In this interactive session, we will visualize the\ncharacteristics of a confidence interval, demonstrate what a confidence\nlevel is, resample data, and create side-by-side comparisons. These\nvisualizations can be used to introduce the topic as well as in\nclassroom assessments.\n\n\nPresenter: Rona Axelrod\n\n\nLink to recording\n\nSeptember 2021 Webinar Experiencing Sampling\nVariation Early and Often in an Intro Statistics Course\n\nUsing data centric lessons and visualization tools such as the\n“Points and Densities Little App” have supported my students’\nunderstanding of the key role sampling variation plays in statistical\ninvestigation. I love overhearing “Hey, my sample looks different from\nyours!” It opens the door to explore whether there is still a consistent\nstory to tell about a variable.\n\n\nPresenter: Carol Howald\n\n\nLink to recording\n\nJune/July 2021 Workshop Creating a Data\nScience Program at a Two-Year College\n\nYou may be contemplating creating a data science program at your\ninstitution, but you are not sure where to start. This recording\nfeatures a panel discussion with several people who have created data\nscience programs at their institutions. The focus was on community\ncolleges because of the unique issue that community college faces with\narticulation and workforce development. However, all institution types\ncould gain some insights to create a program at their institution, so\nall faculty at any college or university are invited to review the\nmaterial and watch the recordings. This one day workshop was offered on\nFriday, June 4, 2021, and repeated on Saturday, July 31, 2021.\n\nThe recording of the June 4th panel discussion is available at the\nfollowing links.\nLink\nto recording\nThe recording of the July 31st panel discussion is available is at\nthe following link.\nLink\nto recording\nFebruary 2021 Resources for Teaching\nStatistics\n\nTeaching an introductory statistics course, but you need some\nguidance. The ASA/MAA Joint Committee, the ASA/AMATYC Joint Committee,\nand the StatPREP grant all have resources to help you teach statistics.\nThis webinar demonstrated the resources from each of these sources.\n\n\nPresenters: Julie Hanson, Rebecca Wong, Kathryn Kozak, and Kari Lock\nMorgan\n\n\nlink to recording\n\nOctober 2020 Data Science in a Box\n\nOur guest was Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, a highly regarded teacher and\none of the authors of the OpenIntro textbooks as well as the online\n“Data Science in a Box” package of teaching materials. We talked with\nMine about the upcoming new edition of the simulation-based OpenIntro\ntextbook and how you can use it in your class. We also covered a range\nof topics, from remote teaching of statistics and data science to Mine’s\n(educated!) predictions about where intro stats is heading in the\n2020s.\n\n\nPresenter: Danny Kaplan.\n\n\nlink to recording\n\nSeptember 2020 Using the Activities for the New\nLittle Apps\n\nIn April 2020, a webinar presented the new StatPREP Little\nApps. This webinar discusses several activities tailored to use\nthe new Little Apps and how to use them in class.\n\n\nPresenters: Kate Kozak, Danny Kaplan.\n\nAugust 11, 2020 Preparing for the fall\nsemester\n\nThere are many materials on the StatPREP site that can help you teach\ndata-centric statistics. This webinar described some of these resources\nthat are ready for Fall 2020.\n\nAugust 7, 2020 Building Community in a Remote\nLearning Environment\n\nA sense of belonging and community is still critical to ensure that\nstudents remain engaged and enthusiastic while being in a remote\nlearning environment. Students may be accustomed to find a sense of\nbelonging from interactions with their peers and classmates in a\nphysical classroom setting. As instruction is delivered virtually,\nstudents may likely feel less connected, uncertain, or distracted in\ntheir new learning environment. Creating a virtual community is just as\nimportant for remote learning as it is in a physical classroom. This\nwebinar presented suggestions to help educators reestablish a sense of\nbelonging for their students.\n\n\nPresenter: Ambika Silva\n\n\nlink to recording\n\nJune 29/30, 2020 Introductory Statistics in the\n2020s: A Virtual Workshop for Two-Year College Educators\n\nThis American Statistical Association workshop focused on ideas and\nactivities for teaching introductory statistics in accordance with the\nAmerican Statistical Association’s GAISE recommendations and “A World\nBeyond P < 0.05” initiative. Highlighted themes included\nmultivariable thinking, data fluency, misconceptions and limitations of\np-values, and alternatives to p-values such as effect sizes.\n\n\nPresenters were Roxy Peck, Rob Gould, Danny Kaplan, Beth Chance, Jeff\nWitmer, and Kari Lock Morgan.\n\n\nAccess\nrecordings here.\n\nMay 18, 2020 What Every Instructor Should Know About\nthe Bootstrap\n\nStatistical concepts such as sampling distributions, standard errors,\nand P-values are difficult for many students. A good way to get hands-on\nexperience with these abstract concepts is using bootstrapping and\npermutation tests, and we’ll demonstrate using a variety of examples.\nThough bootstrapping has enormous potential in statistics education and\npractice, there are subtle issues and ways to go wrong. For example, the\ncommon combination of nonparametric bootstrapping and bootstrap\npercentile confidence intervals is less accurate than using t-intervals\nfor small samples, though more accurate for larger samples. The goals of\nthis talk are to provide a deeper understanding of bootstrap methods –\nhow they work, when they work or not, which methods work better– and to\nhighlight pedagogical issues.\n\n\nPresenter: Tim Hesterberg & Kate Kozak\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nApril 23, 2020 Little App Update\n\nWe celebrated the third anniversary of the StatPREP Little Apps by\nlaunching a brand new\nset of apps with a new look and new functionality. Among the changes\nare a dramatically increased choice of data sets (including those keyed\nto textbooks often used by StatPREP instructors) and the ability to\nupload your own CSV files, a feature that lets you freeze a display and\nshow it side-by-side with the current display. The original apps\ncontinue to be available at their original web addresses, but we\nencourage you to switch to the new ones and try out their new\ncapabilities.\n\n\nPresenters: Jennifer Ward & Danny Kaplan\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nMarch 26, 2020 The p-value: Replacing 0.05 with\nUnderstanding\n\nThe American Statistical Association’s 2016 P-Value Statement and The\nAmerican Statistician’s 2019 special issue “Statistical Inference in the\n21st Century: A World Beyond p < 0.05” both provide a call for action\nand change regarding how p-values are taught and used. In particular,\nthey discourage the focus on whether a p-value is less than a specific\nthreshold (e.g. 0.05), and encourage a better understanding of what the\np-value actually represents. This talk will discuss ways to replace “p\n< 0.05” with conceptual understanding of a p-value in introductory\nstatistics courses.\n\n\nAccess recording here\n\nMarch 13, 2020 StatPREP Webinar: Course Curricula\n& StatPREP\n\nDanny Kaplan and Kate Kozak introduced the three new StatPREP\ncompanion tools for Statistics Using Technology by Kozak, OpenIntro\nStatistics by Diez, et al, and Elementary Statistics by Triola. Do you\nuse one of these books in your introductory statistics classes? If so,\nwatch the webinar recording to learn how StatPREP can help you teach\ndata-centric stats! Even if you don’t use one of the listed books, you\nmay find the materials helpful.\n\n\nPresented by: Danny Kaplan and Kate Kozak\n\n\nAccess recording here\n\nDecember 12, 2019 The Compact Guide to Classical\nInference: Why?\n\nIn Dec. 2019, StatPREP.org started the serial publication of a short\nbook for instructors: The Compact Guide to Classical Inference.\n(Note from March 2020: The full book is available here.](https://dtkaplan.github.io/CompactInference/)) Keeping\nin mind that StatPREP is about centering statistics education on real\ndata, this book is an anomaly: the introduction of a reframed\nmathematical approach to statistical inference. The reframed approach\nunifies into a simple, single standard procedure all the inferential\nsettings found in introductory statistics and carries forward to apply\nto “advanced” settings such as multiple regression.\n\n\nPresenters: Donna LaLonde & Danny Kaplan\n\n\nThe webinar was a conversation between Donna and Danny about how the\nmany formulae and probability tables of historical statistics can be\nunified into a single simple test statistic, F, and an expression for\nthe confidence interval in terms of F.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nNovember 5, 2019 Assessment Webinar\n\nAssessment is an integral part of instruction, as it determines\nwhether or not learning goals are being met and makes us ask, “Are\nstudents learning what they are supposed to be learning?” Learn how to\nuse the StatPREP Little Apps to make meaningful assessments during this\nmonth’s webinar!\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nOctober 23, 2019 MAA Connect\n\nLooking for ways to connect with other StatPREP participants across\nthe country? Do you want to share the wonderful innovated data centric\nways you’re teaching your intro stats course? Join the conversation on\nMAA Connect. This webinar\nshows you how to get onto MAA connect whether you’re an MAA member or\nnot as well as going over the basics of MAA connect.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nSeptember 19, 2019* Using the Activities for Little App\n“Rare and Common”\n\nDo you have an unusually high pulse rate? How can a person find out?\nThis webinar will present an activity developed for the Little App\ncalled “Common and Rare.” This activity is a group activity that is\navailable to use in a class today. The webinar will show you how to use\nthe activity and the Little App in an introductory Statistics course to\nintroduce and investigate the concept of rare and common events\nutilizing the normal curve.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nMarch 27, 2019 Using the Little App “Linear\nModels”\n\nThe webinar gave the first look at the redesign of the Little Apps.\nThe “Linear Models” Little App allows teachers and students to pick\nbetween 4 different datasets and then particular variables to\ninvestigate a linear regression model between the variables. The webinar\nshowed how to use the Little App in your courses to introduce and\ninvestigate regression.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nFebruary 22, 2019 Using the What’s Normal?\nClass Lesson to Introduce the Normal Distribution\n\nThe webinar presented a classroom lesson called “What’s Normal?” that\nmodels data which can be used to explain the normal distribution to your\nclass. The lesson shows the connection between data and the empirical\nrule of the normal curve.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nJanuary 25, 2019 Introducing Your Students to\nMultivariable Data\n\nThis webinar was about introducing students to data. The webinar\npresented two classroom lessons that can be used to explain\nmultivariable data to your class. The first, “A Lesson for the First\nDay,” is used to show your students how data can be used to answer\nquestions. The second, “Using Google Spreadsheets,” has your students\ncollect data in the classroom. Both of these activities can be completed\nearly in the course.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nOctober 26, 2018 Using Little Apps to teach\nTwo-sample t\n\nThe webinar demonstrated how to use in class the Little Apps\n“Two-sample t,” “Proportions”, and “Sampling and resampling.”\n\n\nAccess recording here\n\nSept 7, 2018 Using StatPREP Little Apps to Teach\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nThis webinar focused on the nuts and bolts of designing a class\nlesson around using the little apps for teaching descriptive statistics.\nIt included:\n\n\nWhere to find the little apps\nHow to use the little app to demonstrate center and spread\nPicking different response variables\nShowing mean and standard deviation in graphical output\nShowing 95% confidence interval to introduce the idea of\ninference\nChoosing an explanatory variable and then discussing difference in\nmeans\nSome comments on sample size\nTypes of assessment that can be done\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nApril 20, 2018 Getting a handle on\nANOVA\nFriday, April 20, 2018\n\nThis webinar is about ANOVA, seen from a perspective that we think\nmakes it much easier to understand and is rooted in a display of data.\nwill lead the webinar. Watch the recording to find out what you have\nbeen missing and how to become confident in teaching ANOVA with data.\nThis was our first webinar about the Little Apps series, interactive\ndisplays of data designed to let you an your students explore a\nstatistical method or idea. This webinar featured the app on\none-variable ANOVA.\n\n\nPresenter: Kate Kozak\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nDec 1, 2017 Writing an interactive\ntutorial\n\nAn interactive tutorial is an effective way to provide access to data\ncomputing to students. Tutorials can be arranged so that a student needs\nnothing more than a web browser. Within a tutorial, you can pose\nmultiple choice questions, display results of statistical calculations,\nand provide students with an R session in which they can do their own\ncalculations (with as much or as little guidance from you as you\nwant).\n\n\nThe first step in writing an interactive tutorial is to figure out\nwhat you want the tutorial to cover. In the webinar, we started by\ncreating an Rmd file with some simple but authentic statistical content.\nThen, we added slots for multiple-choice questions and computations.\nFinally, we activated the components that turn an ordinary Rmd file into\nan interactive tutorial.\n\n\nPresenter: Danny Kaplan\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nOctober 27, 2017 Using RStudio to manage your\nwebsite and write course handouts\n\nYou can start teaching with StatPREP without having to set up any\nstatistical software; all our tutorials are available through an\nordinary web browser. But many instructors are interested in going\ndeeper. In particular, we’ve had many calls for instruction on how to\nuse RStudio to create your own documents or customize those available\nthrough StatPREP.\n\n\nRStudio provides the means to write course notes, handouts, and even\ninteractive tutorials. Together with GitHub, it lets you easily set up\ncourse-specific web sites and create materials for those sites. Oh … and\nsince it built on the R software, it’s fully integrated with modern\nsystems for data management, statistics, modeling, and even machine\nlearning.\n\n\nThis webinar introduced RStudio with a focus on creating and updating\ncourse web sites and writing course handouts. We started with the\nRStudio editor, which enables you to revise documents or create new\nones. Also covered: How to link your RStudio account to GitHub so that\nyou can manage your course web site from within RStudio; and how to\ncreate documents for class handouts—simultaneously generating printable\nPDF and web versions.\n\n\nAccess recording here.\n\nSeptember 29, 2017 Setting up your own course web\nsite\n\nA course web site is an essential resource for an instructor: it\nprovides a place for you to post links to StatPREP lessons as well other\ntutorial material and data sets of particular interest to you and even\nyour own course handouts. Many instructors have access to “course\nmanagement software” systems such as Blackboard or Moodle to which\nstudents can log in and view a home page. We focused on another approach\nwhich requires no institutional resources and uses a completely free web\nservice: GitHub. In the webinar, we went through the steps of setting up\na GitHub account and a course “repository”“which serves a complete\nwebsite with an address like ProfAndrews.github.io/Stat4110\n(where you’ll customize the ID and course name to suit your situation).\nThen we demonstrated how to create a web page that can include links to\nStatPREP tutorials and other resources you choose, upload data sets so\nyour students can easily access them, and all the other things that can\nmake your course more accessible and engaging for students.\n\n\n\n\n",
