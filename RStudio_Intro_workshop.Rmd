title: Intro to RStudio Workshop
---

*Introduction to RStudio Workshop**

* The second workshop theme is an Introduction to RStudio. GAISE stresses the idea of using real data, large datasets, and deemphasizing formulas. The best way to follow these guidelines is to use statistical software. One advantage of RStudio is that it is free for students, teachers, and institutions to use. This workshop will introduce you to the basics of RStudio; no prior knowledge of RStudio is expected. This two-day workshop will be offered twice: first on Friday, June 18, and Saturday, June 19, and second on Thursday, July 15, and Friday, July 16.
