title: 2021 StatPREP Workshops
---


Canceling the 2020 summer workshops of StatPREP due to the COVID-19 pandemic was the right decision. Now a new decision has to be made for the 2021 summer workshops. We asked our workshop participants from the four hub locations of Tarrant County College, Howard Community College, Florida SW State College, and Essex County Collegewhat type of workshop they would prefer for this coming summer and they told us: virtual would be best. So virtual it is. The StatPREP Summer 2021 Workshops will be virtual and use a little bit different format to take advantage of online access for participants! 

Our plan for the two-day workshop is to incorporate data centric concepts into the teaching of statistics and demonstrate how to present the concepts using the Little Apps developed by StatPREP. Another two day workshop will introduce faculty to the basics of the statistical software R Studio. In addition there will be a two day intermediate workshop on R Studio. Lastly, there will be a one day workshop on creating a data science workshop at your college. 

The summer schedule is set for all workshops to be offered in June and repeated in July for those who can not attend in June. The content and dates of the workshops are still being finalized. The workshops will have limited enrollment to allow interaction between workshop participants. Please watch for an announcement of the detailed plan, including dates, and that the application to attend a workshop is available. Hope to see you and your colleagues virtually this summer.
