title: 2021 StatPREP Workshops
---

**Summer workshops are scheduled from 12:00 until 3:00 pm eastern daylight time.**

* The first theme is an introduction to the philosophy of StatPREP and several of the Little Apps that can be used to demonstrate datacentric ideas to your students. This two-day workshop will be offered twice: first on Thursday, June 10, and Friday, June 11, and second on Friday, July 9, and Saturday, July 10.

The plan for this StatPREP intro workshop is to have presentations on what it means to have your statistics class be datacentric, and the philosophy behind the ASAâ€™s GAISE statement. There will be hands-on activities on using some of the activities written for the Little Apps, and time for small group discussions.

At the end of the first day there will be time for socializing, and the second day starts with a social hour. The idea is to create a community of instructors who can ask each other for advice. If you are new to teaching statistics or have been teaching for awhile but would like to add more life to your statistics
course, this is a great workshop to attend to learn how to incorporate data into your course and be exposed to the StatPREP material.

* The second workshop theme is an Introduction to RStudio. GAISE stresses the idea of using real data, large datasets, and deemphasizing formulas. The best way to follow these guidelines is to use statistical software. One advantage of RStudio is that it is free for students, teachers, and institutions to use. This workshop will introduce you to the basics of RStudio; no prior knowledge of RStudio is expected. This two-day workshop will be offered twice: first on Friday, June 18, and Saturday, June 19, and second on Thursday, July 15, and Friday, July 16.

* An Intermediate/Advanced RStudio workshop is offered for those who have some experience with RStudio and would like to learn more. This workshop is to expose the attendee to some of the more sophisticated commands of RStudio. An interest RStudio novice could attend the Introduction to RStudio workshop and then attend the Intermediate/Advance RStudio workshop on either Thursday, June 24 through Friday, June 25, or Friday, July 23 through Saturday, July 24.

* You may be contemplating creating a data science program at your institution, but you are not sure where to start. A one-day workshop workshop will feature a panel discussion with several people who have created data science programs at their institutions. The focus will be on community colleges because of the unique issue that community college faces with articulation and workforce development. However, all institution types should gain some insights to create a program at their institution, so all faculty at any college or university are invited to attend. This one day workshop will be offered on Friday, June 4, and repeated on Saturday, July 31.
