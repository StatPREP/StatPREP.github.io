  Some background info about StatPREP

## Welcome to StatPREP!			

Statistics is fundamentally about data; StatPREP is fundamentally about helping instructors teach with data. We work with college instructors who want to teach statistics with a modern pedagogy and with a direct emphasis on real data wrangling and visualization techniques.

StatPREP provides data- and computationally-based curricular materials through this site. Pre-COVID, each June we ran four 1Â½ day workshops in four different major metropolitan areas. Starting in 2021, the workshops will be online. The workshops are designed for instructors whose primary training may not be in statistics and whom may not have previous experience with statistical computing.
