Many StatPREP participants have contacted us with news and questions about data science. The news is typically along these lines:

- *"I've been asked to set up a data-science program at my college."*
- *"There's a new state committee on articulation guidelines for data science. I've been appointed to it."*
- *"I've been tasked to launch a data-science version of intro stats."*

And the questions are often like these:

- *What should be in an intro data-science course?*
- *How can I find materials for the new data-science course I'm supposed to launch in the Fall?*

Two excellent open resources are the [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org) site by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and an introductory textbook by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim, [*Modern Dive: Statistical inference via data science*](moderndive.org).
