# Curricular Guide: Statistics Using Technology, Kozak, 3rd Edition

The book is online and available [here](https://www.coconino.edu/open-source-textbooks#statistics-using-technology-3rd-edition-by-kathryn-kozak).

This document is keyed to the table of contents of the book.

# Chapter 1: Statistical Basics

The `Sugar` data frame is available in  the Little Apps.

- Activity: [Response and Explanatory Variables](http://www.statprep.org/LittleAppSite/posts/Activities/Response_and_explanatory/)

## ยง1.1: Sampling Methods

Each Little App can take a simple random sample from any of the datasets. Choose a large dataset--use "All" for the sample size--and say that for the purpose of demonstration, we'll consider this to be the population. Then show  the process of selecting a simple random sample.

When a categorical explanatory variable is selected, you can also  do a stratified sample. Ask what different between a stratified sample and a simple random sample. (You can turn stratification on and off to see the difference. This will be most obvious when the explanatory variable has very  different numbers of points at the different levels.)

NOTE: There's a StatPREP activity on sampling bias, but it is written  in terms of the confidence interval,  which has not yet been  introduced in this book.
