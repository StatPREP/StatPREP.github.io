> Our guest was Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel,  a highly regarded teacher and one of the authors of the OpenIntro textbooks  as well  as the online “Data Science in  a Box”  package of  teaching  materials. We talked with Mine about the upcoming new edition of the  simulation-based OpenIntro textbook and how you can use it in  your class. We also covered a range of topics, from remote teaching of statistics and data science to  Mine’s (educated!) predictions about where intro stats is heading in the 2020s. Host: Danny Kaplan.

*August 7, 2020* **Building Community in a Remote Learning Environment**

> A sense of belonging and community is still critical to ensure that students remain engaged and enthusiastic while being in a remote learning environment.  Students may be accustomed to find a sense of belonging from interactions with their peers and classmates in a physical classroom setting. As instruction is delivered virtually, students may likely feel less connected, uncertain, or distracted in their new learning environment.  Creating a virtual community is just as important for remote learning as it is in a physical classroom.  This webinar presented suggestions to help educators reestablish a sense of belonging for their students. Host: Ambika Silva [link to recording]
